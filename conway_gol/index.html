    <p>Otherwise known as using the wrong tool for the job. Or not doing it very well.</p>
    <p>Here is the result of my tinkering:</p>
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="life.swf" 
    width="550" height="400"> 

    <param name="movie" value="life.swf" />
    <param name="quality" value="high" />
</object>
    <p>Instructions on how to run it are included in the Flash object. As you can see rather quickly by tinkering with it, it is slow as crud. I never really learned why that is--if tight loops and Flash don't go well together or if it has more to do with how I wrote the ActionScript...I just know that it runs, and that it impressed the high school teacher...but that's as far as I got.</p>
    <p>If you happen to have a copy of Flash you can feel free to inspect the <a href="life.fla">source</a>.</p>
