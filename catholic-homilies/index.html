		<h1>Recordings of homilies from various parishes</h1>
		<p>In preparation for Sunday Mass, I have wanted to hear prior years' homilies to help me unpack what's in the readings. A lot of bad came out of the COVID-19 pandemic, but one good thing is that many parishes started to livestream their Masses in 2020 and have continued since--giving us a robust repository of Mass (and therefore homily) recordings to use.</p>

		<p>I've selected parishes I've had affection for or whose homilies I've found helpful. Inclusions or exclusions are not meant to be a commentary on any parishes; I merely have to start somewhere with such a list.</p>
